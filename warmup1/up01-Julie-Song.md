**2. Cooking Recipe: Salted Butter Chocolate Chunck Shortbread **
-----------------------------------------------------------------

![Salted Butter Chocolate Chunk Shortbread](https://smittenkitchendotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/salted-butter-chocolate-chunk-shortbread.jpg?w=750)

#### Ingredients:

-   1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (9 ounces or 255 grams) salted butter, cold, cut into small pieces
-   1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
-   1/4 cup (50 grams) light brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract
-   2 1/4 cups (295 grams) all-purpose flour
-   6 ounces (170 grams) semi- or bittersweet dark chocolate, chopped (you want chunks, not thin shards of chocolate) 1 large egg
-   Demerara, turbinado, raw, or sanding sugar, for rolling Flaky sea salt for sprinkling

#### "Special" Kitchen Tools:

-   electric mixer
-   parchment paper, waxed paper, or plastic wrap
-   oven
-   freezer
-   baking sheets
-   serrated knife

#### Steps:

1.  Beat the butter, granulated and brown sugars, and vanilla with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, scraping down bowl as needed.
2.  Add flour, and mix just until combined. Add chocolate chunks, mix just until incorporated. Mixture will look crumbly.
3.  Divide between two sheets of parchment paper, waxed paper, or plastic wrap and use your hands to form the dough halves into log shapes about 2 to 2 1/4 inches in diameter.
4.  Chill until totally firm, about 2 hours. I hastened this along in the freezer (30 minutes, tops) but did feel that the cookies were better after resting longer.
5.  When you’re ready to bake the cookies, heat your oven to 350°F.
6.  Line one or two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
7.  Lightly beat the egg and open up your chilled cookies logs to brush it over the sides.
8.  Sprinkle the coarse sugar on the open paper or plastic wrap and roll the logs into it, coating them.
9.  Using a sharp serrated knife, cut logs into 1/2-inch thick rounds. You’re going to hit some chocolate chunks, so saw gently, squeezing the cookie to keep it from breaking if needed.
10. Arrange cookie slices on prepared sheets one inch apart (they don’t spread much) and sprinkle each with a few flakes of salt.
11. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to get golden brown.
12. Let cool slightly before transferring to the cookies you don’t eat immediately to wire racks to cool.

**3. Quadratic Equation **
--------------------------

#### Definition:

-   **Quadratic equation** is any equation having the form
    *a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0
     where x represents an unknown, and *a, b* and *c* represnt known numbers such that *a* is not equal to 0. To find the solution for quadratic equation, use the following formula:
    $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
     (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation))

#### Derivation:

*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0
4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* + 4*a**c* = 0
4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* = −4*a**c*
4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* + *b*<sup>2</sup> = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*
(2*a**x* + *b*)<sup>2</sup> = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*
$$2ax + b = \\pm\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$$
$$2ax = -b \\pm\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$$
$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

**4. Comments and Reflections**
-------------------------------

I really enjoyed this warm-up because I'm a big fan of *Game of Thrones* and inputting info about my favorite character was enjoyable. I think the easy part was basic syntax, such as headers, bulletpoints and italics. But other than that, syntax for mathematical equations and embedding images were quite challenging. this was my first time using markdown and I liked it because was able to check my work by knitting into HTML and also when I knit, it automatically saves my work, so I didn't really need to press save every single time. I needed help with embedding images because for some reason, it wasn't quite working for me, so I went to office hours for help. It took aroung 2 - 3 hours to complete this HW, looking up for codes and information to put into the warm-up. The most time consuming part was table, as I was so confused trying to not to make R think that the first row is the header. I didn't know how to code to make the first row of the table as header and I struggled quite a bit. But overall, I really enjoyed it!
